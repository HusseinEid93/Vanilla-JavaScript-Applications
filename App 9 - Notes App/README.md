# Notes App 

Create your own notes (as many as you want). The created notes are automatically saved by the browser so that they are automatically downloaded whenever you back. 

## Note: 
*You have to fill in the notes in the same syntax as if you write .md files. The implementation of the code automatically transform the text you type to a .md file style.*
